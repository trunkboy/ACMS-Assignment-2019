#Problem statement :
# The cross-sectional area of a gutter is (b + lcos(theta))*lsin(theta)
# Assume that the width of the material to be bent into the gutter shape is 6 units.
# FInd the andke theta and the edge length l, which maximizes the cross-sectional area of the gutter with the constratin:
#  b= 6-2l
# Consider the initial interval of theta from 0 to pi/2 and l from 0 to 3.
